The **Earn** tab is the main part of Blox-Grow — it’s where you complete simple tasks to earn Robux.

Here’s how it works:

## Offerwalls

Inside the Earn section, you’ll find multiple **offerwalls** from verified partners with Blox-Grow like CPX-Research, Bitlabs, Wannads, and more.

The offerwalls includes tasks such as:
- **Completing surveys**
- **Playing games**
- **Downloading mobile apps**
- **Watching videos**
- **Signing up for services**

> Example: Install a game and reach level 10 to earn 20 Robux.

Personally, I prefer the **CPX-Research** offerwall for its variety of surveys and the time to reward ratio, but you can try different ones to see which works best for you.
Remember, you can always switch between offerwalls to find the ones that pay the best for you.

## Track Your Progress

Most offerwalls show the following for each task:
- How much Robux you’ll earn
- What you need to do
- Estimated time to complete

Once finished, your reward is sent **instantly** to your Blox-Grow balance or within a few minutes.

> If it takes longer than 48 hours, you can check the **Recent Offers or Pending** tab on the offerwall or contact both offerwall support and Blox-Grow support with necessary proof of completion.

## Tips for Success

- Always **read the offer instructions** before starting.
- **Disable ad blockers**: this can lead to tasks being blocked or restricted by your ad blocker.
- **Do not use fake information**: this can lead to offers being revoked.
- Try to **stay in the same region** you use to login: changing regions or using VPNs can lead to bans or revoked offers by the offerwall providers.
- Use a **real email** and details when required.
- Complete tasks **fully**: some tasks require you to reach a certain level or complete a specific action.
- Try **multiple offerwalls**: different ones may work better depending on your region.
- **Keep consistent** with your answers: switching up your age, job, or interests can lead to offers being revoked or refunded in the future.

## Important Notes

- We never ask for your **Roblox login**. If you see any site or person asking for your Roblox password other than roblox.com, it’s a scam.
- Blox-Grow staff members will **never** ask for your login credentials. 
- Do **not** use VPNs or fake information — this may result in offers being revoked.
- If you have issues with an offer, contact the **offerwall support** first, then reach out to Blox-Grow support if needed.
- Blox-Grow will **never endorse** a product or service that requires you to pay money to earn Robux. If you see such offers, they are likely scams.
